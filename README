Acme-Geo-Whitwell-Name

This module allows you to convert latitudes and longitudes to Steadman
Whitwell's "rational geographic nomeclature": unique place names that 
are generated directly from the latitude and longitude.[1] Whitwell 
despaired of the many duplicate Springfields and Washingtons in the 
United States, and proposed this nomenclature to prevent duplicate
placenames.

The system is set up to use latitudes and longitudes precise to two
decimal places; using standard maximum measurements for latitude and
longitude[2], this allows a grid of approximately 800 feet by 1300 feet
to be overlaid on the globe. Most towns and villages are at least this big,
so 2-decimal precision is sufficient to give each one a unique name.

Allowing for the utter lunacy of the whole scheme, it has a certain
obsessive charm.

This module is at its core a simple text transformation, so it requires very
little beyond core Perl functions. It does not at present do geocoding, so
you will have to determine the latitude and longitude yourself.
